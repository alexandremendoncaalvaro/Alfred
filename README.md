# Alfred (original draws and animations)
Internal use (our company team) SQL Editor tool with a fully animated interface.
This validates the SQL scripts to avoid mistakes when interact direct in homologation database (for obvious reasons, some functions and backend are not included here).

*Except the first batman (that we downloaded) all characters are originally drawn in Illustrator, and animation with Greensock JS lib.

## How to play
You can use any username a password to access. (pay attention to Batman's reactions when you type).

Click around Alfred's body, arms, legs and face...

Resize the window (to a really small width)...

Try to type real SQL commands in the editor:
```
SELECT * FROM test
```
```
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value_1, value_2)
```
```
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = 'new_value' WHERE column_name = 'old_value'
```
```
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE (condition)
```
or things like:
```
batman
```
```
kkk
```
```
moon
```

...and see the magic!
