# Alfred
Internal use SQL Editor tool with a fully animated interface (Original draws, animation, etc).
It's validates the SQL scripts (backend not included here).

The git publishing purpose is to sharing my original frontend animations with SVGs.

Demo:  
<https://alexandremendoncaalvaro.github.io/Alfred>

You can use any username a password to access. (pay attention to Batman's look when you type).

Click around Alfred's body, arms, legs and face...

Resize the window...

Try to type real SQL commands in the editor, or things like:
```
batman
```
```
kkk
```
```
moon
```

...and see the magic!
